GenAlpha brings the power of AI to automate their most painful bottlenecks.\\n\\nGenAlpha founding engineers will work in a dynamic & high-growth environment, directly with our founders and customers, including some of the world’s biggest & highest-impact semiconductor designers & fabs.\\n\\nDevelop AI agents for novel chip design problems\\nExperience with LLM-based systems & agents, LLM encodings, foundation models, ML systems, fine-tuning, RAG, GraphRAG all pluses\\nDevelop automated methods to extract structured data from diverse sources including documents & images\\nTest & characterize natural language AI systems\\nRequires proficiency with one or more of Python, TypeScript, C++, Rust\\nBonus points for high-performance front-end or GUI development experience, and for silicon EDA experience. (Don't worry if you never heard of that last one.)\\n\\nWe value software generalists & polyglots who are unafraid to try & learn new & valuable tools, wherever they can be found. Past experience in cloud-native B2B and customer-facing engineering roles is a plus. Desire to grow into engineering leadership is a plus. Desire to work in a rapidly changing, early stage startup environment is a must.\",\n",

Our workforce management platform helps some of the fastest-growing, most innovative companies in the world—including Stripe, Etsy, and Robinhood—to schedule, forecast, and organize their support teams. We’ve raised $70m in funding from the likes of NEA, Emergence Capital, and Stripe itself. You’ll be joining a special group of people who learned the ropes at companies like Stripe, Google, Atlassian, Twitter, Airbnb, Looker, NEA, Bain, and more.\\n\\nWe’re looking for a Product Engineer to join our Vendor Management Team. As a Product Engineer, you will take ownership of multiple parts of Assembled’s vendor management product, driving projects from start to finish. Your work will directly impact the largest customer support teams in the world (think teams with tens of thousands of agents!) by allowing our top customers to manage their outsourced support at scale. The vendor management side of the product is still nascent. We launched in 2023, and already the product is used (and was instrumental in closing) 6 out of our top 10 customers. As a result, we’re a small scrappy team that has a lot of ground to cover. Our Product Engineers are often involved in various aspects of their projects, from discovery calls (and going onsite!) with customers to design reviews with the UX team to writing support articles ahead of a product launch.\\n\\nSome Projects Shipped By The Vendor Management Team\\n\\nSchedule Integrations: We built out a platform to integrate with vendors and pull in all of their agents along with agents schedules — a level of visibility they weren’t able to get to without Assembled.\\nVendor scorecard (in progress): We’re currently building out ****a way for customers to set goals for their vendors, track their vendors’ progress against these goals, and incentivize competition across vendors to be a high performer (and thus receive a higher % of support volume).\\nCustom Permissions: We built a platform for allowing customers to configure arbitrarily complex permissions, and keep data silo’d within a vendor. You can read more about the project here.\\n\\nAbout You\\n\\nYou’re product-focused. You have customer empathy, and the things you build always keep the end-user in mind. You often think about how your work impacts the overall user experience.\\nYou’re excited about working on all parts of the stack.

You’re a natural builder and have a combination of product, design, engineering, and communication skills. Ideally you’ve launched your own side projects or have experience working at an early stage start up.\\nYou enjoy solving hard problems that have both product and technical ambiguity. Many of the problems in the support space have existed for decades without great solutions. They are often a mix of both product challenges (how do we transform a complex agent workflow into an intuitive user experience?) and technical challenges (how do we process rapidly-changing agent state data in near-realtime?).\\n\\nThe estimated base salary range for this role is $125,000 - $220,000 per year.
